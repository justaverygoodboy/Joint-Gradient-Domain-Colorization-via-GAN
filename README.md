# Joint-Gradient-Domain-Colorization-via-GAN
This is the code of my graduation thesis

To alleviate the edge color overflow and abnormal color problems, we propose a colorization model based on GAN which contains one generator and two discriminators, one working on pixel domain and the other working on gradient domain.
